# Cardano open oracle protocol

## Introduction

Cardano open oracle protocol (COOP) is an SDK for publishing and consuming
on-chain data using Cardano CIP-31 reference inputs. Reference inputs allow a
data provider to publish a data point once and multiple consumers to use the
data point in on-chain dApp scripts, without interfering with each other.

The purpose of this project is to provide a clean and simple example of how to
use reference inputs in practice, with sufficient detail and documentation to
allow the Cardano ecosystem to use this functionality as painlessly as possible.
It is also a stepping stone towards building the broader
[Orcfax](https://www.orcfax.link/about/) oracle platform.

This project was graciously funded from the Cardano Treasury in Catalyst Fund 8:

## Documentation

The project is described in further detail by the following documents:
- [docs/design.md](docs/design.md) — describes the design goals, options
  considered, and the rationale for the design option selected for
  implementation.
- [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md) — breaks down the project into milestones
  that group features in a progressively expanding scope until the launch
  version, and outlines the timeline for the milestones at a high level.
